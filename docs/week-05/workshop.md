# Week 5 - Workshop - Satisfaction

## What you will learn

- You know how to make an informed decision based on data and data analysis.
- More precisely, you can analyze which group of employees is unhappy/happy and about which aspects of their job.
- You are able to explore and analyze various variables of your choice using graphs and tests to arrive at a conclusion.

## What you will need to prepare

- Re-read the case study of the Myriad Hotel, specifically on the topic of staff satisfaction.
- Remember that you read the case study of the Myriad Hotel in week 1 (see Moodle). Now study the case in more detail and pay special attention to the bold highlighted elements that could be important for employee satisfaction.
- Consider all variables in the dataset that might be relevant to answer this question: *Are all Myriad employees happy with the current employment situation (or parts of it) at the Myriad Hotel?*
- Note that the case study text can give valuable hints about where to start and focus your analysis.
- Specifically, look into the relations between:
    - Staff satisfaction with **salary** and their actual **salary**, based on 1.0 FTE (tip: **compute**).
    - Staff satisfaction with **relations at work** and their **seniority** in the hotel.
    - Staff satisfaction with **growth opportunities** and their number of **training days**.
    - Staff satisfaction with **recognition at work** and **gender**.
    - Staff satisfaction with **salary**, **relations at work**, **recognition**, and **growth** for managers versus operatives.
      - Cut-off point: staff is in management if salary > EUR 2,500 per month (tip: **transform**).
    - Bonus: check no. 1 again on **salary**, now separately for managers and operatives. Try to explain.
