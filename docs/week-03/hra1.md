# Week 3 - HRa1 - Descriptives & graphs

## What you will learn

- Practice your Jamovi skills and get more familiar with Jamovi.
- You know how to visualize data in Jamovi.
- You know the different measurement levels, center measures, and what variance is.
- You know how to create various graphs for different variables.

## What you will need to prepare

- Watch the video below.
    - [Slides](./Week%203%20HRA2%20Measurement%20levels.pptx) from the video.
    - In case you have difficulties with the measurement levels, also check §2.2 - Scales of measurement (in the *Jamovi* book).
- Decision trees for [measurement levels](./Week%203%20HRA2%20Measurement%20levels.pptx) and [graphs](./Week%203%20HRA%203%20Graphs_only%20decision%20tree.pdf).
- Read the following chapters from the *Jamovi* book:
    - §4.1 - Measures of central tendency
    - §4.2 - Measures of variability
    - §4.4 - Descriptive statistics separately for each group
    - Chapter 5 - Drawing graphs
- Get to know the variables in the dataset of the Myriad hotel:
    - What do the variables mean?
    - What are the measurement levels of your variables?
    - Create a minimum of 4 graphs of 4 single variables that you are interested in. Be prepared to share.
    - Create a minimum of 4 graphs combining 2 variables that you are interested in. Be prepared to share.
