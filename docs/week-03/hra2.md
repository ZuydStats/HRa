# Week 3 - HRa2 - Estimation and hypothesis testing

## What you will learn

- You know how estimation is done and what you can do with it.
- You are familiar with the terms `point estimates`, `confidence intervals`, `degree of certainty`, `significance`, and `one-tailed` or `two-tailed` tests.

## What you will need to prepare

- Read the following chapters in *Jamovi*:
    - §8.1 - Samples, populations and sampling
    - §8.4 - Estimating population parameters
    - §8.5 - Estimating a confidence interval
- Create a possible exam question. It should be a multiple-choice question with 4 answers, of which one is correct. Submit the question two working days before class at the bottom of this page.
- Bring to class (from the video):
    - How does the significance (alpha) tie into Type I and Type II errors?
    - Your beautiful drawing of a confidence interval.
- Memorize the definition of statistical significance:
    - Statistical significance is a determination that a relationship between two or more variables is caused by something other than chance.
    - Statistical significance is used to provide evidence concerning the plausibility of the null hypothesis, which hypothesizes that there is nothing more than random chance at work in the data.
    - Statistical hypothesis testing is used to determine whether the result of a data set is statistically significant.
    - Generally, a p-value lower than 5% is considered statistically significant. (www.investopedia.com, dd.11.02.2022. See also Verhoeven N., *Doing Research*, p. 25)
