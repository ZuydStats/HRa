Twice a week, you will participate in our flipped-classroom classes. These sessions are 60 minutes and are labelled as `5HRA1` and `5HRA2`.

Once a week, you will participate in a workshop where you can practice your new skills. These sessions are also 60 minutes and are labelled as `5HRA3`. Bring your laptop to this meeting and make sure [Jamovi](./faq.md#software) is installed. 

You will have an online Q&A in Week 8 (as exam prep). These sessions are labelled as `5HRA.Q&A` in your roster in MyX.

The entire planning of the course can be found here (in the sidebar on the left).

## What does the exam look like?
The exam consists of 60 multiple-choice questions with four answer options each. Your score is determined using relative scoring (Cohen–Schotanus method), and a correction for guessing is applied.

The Cohen–Schotanus method means that your grade is determined in relation to the performance of the whole group, using the highest score achieved as a reference point. This is beneficial because it protects you against an exam that turns out to be more difficult than expected. If the test is harder for everyone, the grading scale adjusts accordingly, ensuring fairness. Your result therefore reflects how well you performed compared to your peers under the same conditions, rather than being strictly tied to a fixed percentage of correct answers.

In addition, a guessing correction is applied because each question has four options. Since random guessing gives a 25% chance of being correct, the scoring system compensates for this.

### Do we really need to buy the book?
The book is free...
There are many difficult formulas mentioned in the books, do we need to know these by heart?
No, except for one (the only formula you need to know is the formula on expected cell values in a cross tabulation).
Otherwise, you need to be able to understand every concept, but you will not need to know formulas from memory.

### I missed (part of) a class. Could you record the lesson so I can watch it again later?
No, we will not record any live classes. Recording conflicts with the GDPR, and Zuyd rules on this privacy policy. 
Also, live classes are not meant to serve as self-study material. The explainer video's on Moodle are, however.

#### How do I prepare for my resit?
The meeting description of each meeting shows the learning goals and the recommended learning materials.
After you have learned all material, make sure to try the formative test and see how well you master the learning material.

### Q&A sessions
We organize a Q&A session to help you with remaining questions you might have after studying.
