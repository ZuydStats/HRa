# Week 8 - HRa2 - Q/A Session

This meeting will focus on remaining questions. We expect you to master all learning material. Questions that remain after studying all learning material will be dealt with in this meeting. Feel free to ask any question as long you made sure to have studied the learning materials that are required first.
