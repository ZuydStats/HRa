# Week 4 - Workshop

## Workshop (HRA3) - People Power Planning

### What you will learn

- You know how to make an informed decision based on data and data analysis.
- You know how to set up data analysis for an HR plan for the expansion of a hotel.
- You are familiar with going beyond the data in your data set and using it to adapt to future changes.

### What you will need to prepare

- Re-read the case study of the Myriad Hotel, specifically on the topic of power planning.
- Go over the material on quantitative staffing that you have studied with your HR-plan group.

### Your in-class materials

- You read the case study of the Myriad Hotel in week 2 (see Moodle). Re-read this text and keep in mind that the capacity of the Myriad Hotel will double because of the expansion (see top of page 4).
- Charles suggests to "double the number of staff in rooms and F&B departments", while Stefan wants to do things differently, based on the data.
  - What would you do?
- You can try some of the following analyses:
  - Not all staff might be equally productive. See which staff has the lowest productivity (in quality/quantity).
  - Check the relation between productivity and salary (1.0 FTE, transform/calculate; set FTE to continuous) by making a scatterplot.
  - Use filters to look at which managers are delivering the lowest quality.
  - Next to salary, qualification level might be a factor. Use a box plot to check whether higher-qualified employees are more reliable performers, and/or are less absent in their work.
  - The labour market is very tight. Maybe current employees working part-time (0.5 FTE) can be tempted to work more hours. Use a clustered bar chart to check whether women work part-time more often than men (for this to work, consider changing the variable FTE to a more appropriate type). Follow up with a chi-square test to check whether any difference you found is actually significant.
- Combine these results with your preparation and prior knowledge on staffing to deliver your advice.
