# Week 4 - HRa2 - Crosstabs and the chi-square test

## What you will learn

- You will know how to visualize data of two variables in Jamovi.
- You are familiar with crosstabulations (contingency tables in Jamovi) and the associated chi-square test.

## What you will need to prepare

- Read from the *Jamovi* book:
  - [§10.2 - The chi-square test of independence (or association)](https://davidfoxcroft.github.io/lsj-book/10-Categorical-data-analysis.html#the-chi2-test-of-independence-or-association)
  - [§10.4 - Effect size](https://davidfoxcroft.github.io/lsj-book/10-Categorical-data-analysis.html#effect-size)
  - [§10.5 - Assumptions of the test](https://davidfoxcroft.github.io/lsj-book/10-Categorical-data-analysis.html#assumptions-of-the-tests)
- Watch both videos below:

- Use a graph to inspect the difference in **qualification level** and **full-time equivalent** (`fte`) and check if this difference is significant using Crosstabs. Then watch the video on Crosstabs below and check whether you did this correctly. Note down any questions that you might have.
- Create at least one crosstabulation and graph of a combination of two relevant variables that interest you to visualize the data. Also test this association using the chi-square test and determine whether this association is significant. Be prepared to show and explain this during the meeting.

## Your in-class materials

- Your own crosstabulation and questions on this topic.
