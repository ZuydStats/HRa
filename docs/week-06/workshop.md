# Week 6 - Workshop - Performance Appraisal

## What you will learn

- You know how to make an informed decision based on data and data analysis.
- You can link employee performance to other variables in the dataset.
- You are able to explore and analyze various variables of your choice to arrive at an informed decision.
- You are able to convince your client (for whom you perform the data analysis) with arguments using statistical significance.

## What you will need to prepare

- Context: The staff roster of the Myriad is in need of change. Stefan, the CFO of the Myriad, is passionate about HR and decided to hire a change manager to ease the transition. One of the first tasks for the change manager is to independently evaluate the performance of each employee. However, after the results come in, the change manager is puzzled by them.
- Re-read the Myriad Hotel case, and focus on the different approaches to management Stefan and Charles have. What would you expect, based on what you know about the Myriad Hotel, about how different employees perform at work? Why?
- Analyze the different variables on performance, and formulate advice to Myriad Hotel management on the current and desired performance of their staff. Be as specific and detailed as possible after analyzing the data.
- Specifically, you could look into the relations between:
    - Staff performance **quality** and **quantity** with their **salary**, based on 1.0 FTE (tip: **compute**).
    - Staff performance **quality** and **quantity** with their **qualification level**.
    - Staff performance (**all six forms**) with **gender** (tip: clustered bar charts).
    - Staff performance **adaptability** and **reliability** with their **seniority** in the hotel.
    - Different measures of **performance** (6) with different measures of **satisfaction** (4) (choose yourselves).
        - Bonus: start by **recoding** performance into groups: *underachievers*, *satisficers*, and *maximizers*.
