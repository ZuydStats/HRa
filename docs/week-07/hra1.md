# Week 7 - HRa1

The name of the meeting in your schedule corresponds with the name between the brackets (e.g., HRA2).

## Meeting 1 (HRA1)

### Learning goals

- Discuss your new hospitality case in detail with your group members.
- Present **your plan** for analysis of the data and presentation of the results.
- Present the first few graphs, tables, and tests with which you explore the data.

### What you will need to prepare

*You are asked to analyze the data, and present your findings in two weeks.*

- The meeting preparations can be found in the [meeting description](./Week%207%20and%208%20-%20Myriad%20turnover%20business%20case.pdf).
- For this workshop and the last one next week, we will work with [a new dataset about turnover](./Turnover.sav).

### Note

This new case is meant for you to get additional practice with operations, concepts, graphs, and statistical tests. Participating in these sessions is therefore good exam preparation. In the very last workshop next week, we will continue with this assignment and ask each group to present their solution to the given management problem.

### On-demand teaching

- In week 7, 8, or 9 you can ask your lecturer to sit down with you to discuss specific questions you have on the course content.
- We call this "on-demand teaching".
- You need a minimum of three students, a proposed timeslot (30 minutes), and a list of questions you want to discuss.
- You can email your lecturer to make the appointment.
