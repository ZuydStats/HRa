"Suppose you are a hotel manager and you want to improve the employee journey. Obviously, you can improve this, but you also want to know whether your employees are actually more satisfied with their employee journey. This improvement can be evaluated using the skills you learn in HR analytics. Using these research skills you can evaluate your improvements in a systematic way. This evaluation allows you to assess whether your improvements actually led to improved employee satisfaction. This is an example where your research skills and statistical knowledge are useful. You will use these skills not only when you finish your bachelor, but also earlier: when you work in your operational internship; when you create and test a new hospitality concept in module 9 and 10 next year (third year); when you execute a consultancy assignment in you final year; and, also, when you do individual research in your management internship in your final year. So basically, the extent to which you acquire these skills here, determine, in part, your success in the rest of your bachelor."
