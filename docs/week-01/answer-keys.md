# Week 1 - Answer keys

- Question 1: D; We are dealing with means (averages), not proportions. We already suspect that male students work more, therefore we conduct an upper tail.
- Question 2: C; We are interested in the proportion and we suspect that that proportion has decreased as a result of our campaign. So our test will be a lower tail test.
- Question 3: C; We want to find out whether TRIVAGO is used by more people. We are dealing with a population proportion. We want to test whether TRIVAGO is used by more people.
- Question 4: B; A is wrong for we are dealing with a mean, not a proportion. One has no idea whether students study more or less than 40 hours, so we conduct a two-tailed test.
- Question 5: B; The alternative hypothesis shows the direction of the expected difference.
- Question 6: C; This is a test about a difference in population proportion, so D is wrong. The expectation is that the proportion of women is higher.
- Question 7: C; We are looking at mean study delay (in months) for men and women. The researcher expects to find a larger mean value for men.
