Case examples 
1. The growing importance of live music festivals in Spain has led to their consolidation as a 
strategic element in the development of tourism in many destinations. This has been due to 
the fact that these musical and social events have been attracting more and more people 
based on the product bundle made of many concerts for a single ticket at a lower price 
(Vallbona, 2015). A “live music festival” is defined by Leenders (2010) as “an event oriented 
toward music, where several performers/artists perform live for an audience. Festivals are 
commonly held outdoors, and most of the time they include other activities and attractions 
besides the performances, such as food and social activities. Festivals are annual, or repeat at 
some other interval”. Many people from different demographic and socioeconomic 
backgrounds attend music festivals, making these events one of the most characteristic 
manifestations of mass cultural consumption in today's society. Since festival-goers are 
multi-generational and the members of different generational cohorts have not shared the 
same socio-cultural experiences, the different social and cultural events attended by such 
persons have probably had a different impact on the attitudes, preferences, or predominant 
trends of each generation based on the communication channel that is used.  
(Llopis-Amorós, Gil-Saura, Ruiz-Molina, & Fuentes-Blasco, 2019) 
2. Development Dimensions International, a talent management firm, reports that one-third of 
employers use personality tests for hiring and promotion (Wilkie, 2013). Companies are 
rightly concerned with the personality traits of those they hire, consequently by testing, they 
hope to match the employee most suited to the task (Mishra, 2014). Academic counselors 
endeavor to place students into the career field that best matches the student's personality 
(Golle, Rose, & Göllner, 2018). Leadership is also a valuable skill that companies (and 
academia) want in their employees (students) (Isacke, 2013; Remedios, 2012). There are 
many definitions of leadership and it seems that every researcher has his/her own (Stogdill, 
1974). This research uses the definition of Kouzes and Posner (2012). They state that 
leadership is not preordained, rather it is learned; it is a set of observable patterns of 
practices and behaviors and of a discernible set of skills and abilities. Classroom leadership 
has been found to have many outcomes, including involvement in community affairs, ability 

to gain professional experience (Leventhal, 1999), and early career success (Boone & 
Peborde, 2008). As Cook and Wolverton (2002) noted educators are now charged with 
graduating students who are prepared to enter the workforce, with communication skills, 
problem solving abilities, and critical thinking skills. One way to prepare our students is to 
help develop those individuals with leadership capabilities. 
(Weber, 2019) 
3. Over the past 30 years, China has experienced fast-paced economic growth. Chinese 
residents' happiness levels, however, seemed to lag (Graham, Zhou, & Zhang, 2017). 
According to the Helliwell, Layard, and Sachs (2016), the People's Republic of China ranked 
83 out of 157 participating countries in the study of World Happiness Report, with the first 
being Denmark and the 157th being Burundi. The Chinese government has made a great 
effort to improve the welfare of its residents. The relationship between travel, happiness, 
and quality of life represents a new line of research deserving further investigation. The 
ability to be happy is a central criterion for the quality of life (Lyubomirsky, Sheldon, & 
Schkade, 2005). Nawijn (2011a; 2011b) found that travel catalyzes happiness in three 
stages—pre-travel anticipation stage, positive experiences during travel stage, and afterglow 
effect at the post-travel stage. In particular, people who plan a vacation are happier than 
people who do not, partially because happiness encompasses the anticipation of events yet 
to happen. 
(Wei, Ma, Jiang, & We, 2019) 
4. Obesity is defined as having a BMI (body mass index = weight/height2) of 30 or above. 
Currently, based on epidemiological studies, this is a widespread health crisis (Conway et al., 
2018; Rogers, Ferrari, Mosely, Lang, & Brennan, 2017). In the USA alone, more than two-
thirds of adults are considered overweight or obese (Pozza & Isidori, 2018). The prevalence 
of obesity among children and adolescents (Skinner, Ravanbakht, Skelton, Perrin, & 
Armstrong, 2018), combined with the growing number of obese women who gave birth (a 
predictor of child obesity), suggest that the share of obese people will continue to grow 
(Wilson, 2012). The issue of the obese people's participation in leisure activities, among them 
dining out, has considerable social significance and strongly impacts people's quality of life. 
Being able to participate in the full spectrum of activities in one's society has long been 
recognized as a basic human right, which society must act to ensure, whether through 
legislation or by changing social norms.  
(Poria, Beal, & Shani, 2019) 
5. Travel experience amongst the students has been on the increase influenced by discounted 
travel and tour packages for students, international student exchange programmes, and a 
general push by universities to send students abroad for cultural and educational 
experiences. Past travel experience to a destination could impact their future travel decision 
and choices (Kim et al. 2012). The literature also suggests that perceptions and interest of 
tourists about a destination impacts their travel behaviour and choice of destination (Beerli 
and Martin, 2004, Bonn et al., 2005, Chon, 1991, Echtner and Ritchie, 2003). In examining the 
role of motivations, prior travel experience, social ties and destination choice in pre-trip 
attitude of the American university students, authors Nyaupane, Paris, and Teye (2011) find 
that academic motivations and social ties influence students'.  
(Mohsin, Lengler, & Chaiya, 2017) 

6. Significant shifts occur as a new generational cohort enters the workforce. Richardson and 
Thomas (2012) address the challenges experienced by the hospitality industry in retaining 
these younger employees. One step toward retention involves learning about problems 
associated with Millennial entry into organizations. Currently, four generations may be 
working side by side in organizations, including Traditionalists, Baby Boomers, Generation X, 
and Millennials. It is critical to understand these generational cohorts in order to 
comprehend how differences among them affect workplace perceptions and 
behaviors. Among their less positive characteristics, Millennials are said to crave jobs that are 
fun and that involve ample praise and rewards (Tews et al., 2015). They are described as 
demanding, impatient, and lacking in job loyalty. With these negative attributes often 
associated with this generation, it becomes interesting to consider the reactions of 
hospitality managers to Millennials and their rule violations when entering the workplace. 
(Rosa, & Hastings, 2016) 
7. Perceived crowding is the subjective evaluation of density levels in a specific surrounding 
(Shelby & Heberlein, 1984) and is usually defined as a negative assessment of visitor density 
within a given area (Graefe, Vaske, & Kuss, 1984). Loo’s (1974) and Shelby’s (1980) early 
studies show that an increase in the amount of encounters influences peoples’ perceptions, 
and in turns their behavior. Research suggests that crowding issues arise when a large 
number of people are gathered together, and the usage of environmental and/or social 
resources exceeds the limit by physical environment (Lee & Graefe, 2003). In this case, 
visitors perceive the density of people in the place as too high and feel the negative effects of 
crowding, which might result in a lower level of customer satisfaction (Buckley, 2009, Ryan 
and Cessford, 2003, Saveriades, 2000).
