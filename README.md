HRa Wiki
This repository contains the course wiki for HRa, including weekly meeting materials (HRA1, HRA2, HRA3/workshop), study resources, and additional review modules.

It is built with MkDocs and organized by week under docs/, so students can quickly find preparation tasks, in-class activities, and supporting materials.
